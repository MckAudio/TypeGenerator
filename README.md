# TypeGenerator
Script to generate classes for C++ and types for Typescript from JSON data

## Get Started

```bash
npm install

node . ./example/example.json
```

Look at the example JSON files in the subdirectory. Each JSON file defines classes and their members. Each JSON file you use with the TypeGenerator should follow the `FileType` typescript class.
